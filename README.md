-Created npx create-react-app buddy-bites
-deleted unneccesary files and created first component using (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyFWr9zpylM)
as a refrence

8/9/23
Had a hard time knowing where to start, so I've been going over the core fundamentals of html, css, js, and dom

8/10/23
Tried  multiple code alongs, but none of it seems to be sticking, realized i'm in tutorial hell


8/11/23
Trying to follow along with the inclass movie code along again with some concepts losing me and tring to understand them

8/12/123
Going through code academy to redo React exercises starting with completing JSX

8/13/23
Have notebook full of JSX notes, and actually have an understanding of what direction I'm headed now as I complete the 
compenents, props, and hooks section of code academy

8/14/23
Studying through the night, took too long trying to restudy the material, but wouldn't have been able to know where to start without 
taking tons of notes and filling my knowledge gaps. Have to make an attempt to at the very least meet MVP. 

-Attempted to update css, but not changing. BiteBiddy still rendering
-Api not connecting and unsure if I put the JavaScript fetch in the wrong place.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
